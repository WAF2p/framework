description: >
  Privileged roles are minimized, time-bound, reviewed; separation of duties is enforced.

rationale: >
  Sovereignty requires demonstrable control over jurisdictions, access, encryption keys, dependencies and the ability to exit.

implementation_guidance:
  - "Document scope, allowed regions and data classes."
  - "Enforce via policy-as-code and IaC guardrails wherever possible."
  - "Continuously detect drift and keep audit evidence versioned."
