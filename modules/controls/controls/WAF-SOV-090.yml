description: >
  Egress is controlled (deny-by-default or strict allow-list) and exfiltration detection is in place.

rationale: >
  Sovereignty requires demonstrable control over jurisdictions, access, encryption keys, dependencies and the ability to exit.

  - "Document scope, allowed regions and data classes."
  - "Enforce via policy-as-code and IaC guardrails wherever possible."
